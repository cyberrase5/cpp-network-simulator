# Doxygen
Doxygen-generated documentation is found in htlm directory, there are lots of files but the first, annotated.html is the one you likely want. 

# Contents


The actual project documentation in PDF format must be commited in this folder before the deadline. 
Separate PDF document needs to be provided also if your project uses Doxygen for inline documentation.


The document should contain the following parts:

1. **Overview:** what the software does, what it doesn't do? (this can be taken/updated from the project plan)
2. **Software structure:** overall architecture, class relationships (diagram very strongly recommended), interfaces to external libraries
3. **Instructions** for building and using the software
4. **How to compile the program** ('make' should be sufficient), as taken from git repository. If external libraries are needed, describe the requirements here
5. How to use the software: a basic user guide
